                        <p> <strong> Mode Collapse Detection Strategies in Generative Adversarial Networks for Credit Card Fraud Detection </strong></p>
                        <p>This research addresses the vital need for accurate mode collapse detection in GANs to enhance credit card fraud detection. Employing GANs for numerical data generation, the comprehensive framework utilizes various evaluation measures, including loss metrics, Wasserstein Distance, precision, recall, and visualization tools to detect mode collapse. The introduction of an early alert mechanism allows timely intervention and modifications to the training process, optimizing GAN training and improving synthetic data quality.</p>

                        <p> <strong>Credit Card Fraud Detection with Machine Learning Techniques </strong></p>
                        <p>This study compared Logistic Regression, Gaussian Naive Bayes, and deep learning algorithms (ANN, CNN, GAN) for credit card fraud detection. Deep learning techniques outperform traditional machine learning algorithms, and GAN emerges as a promising choice among all other methods due to its high accuracy and advantageous precision-recall trade-off.</p>

                        <p> <strong> Deep learning-based Anomaly Detection in Credit Card Transactions </strong></p>
                        <p>This study demonstrates remarkable results on the performance of CNN and ANN in credit card fraud detection using a balanced dataset. The CNN algorithm demonstrates exceptional proficiency in reducing instances of false positives, which confers a significant benefit in safeguarding the authenticity of legitimate transactions. On the other hand, the ANN algorithm exhibits superior performance in minimizing false negatives, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of security measures.</p>

                        <p>The goal of this research is to help researchers to gain an understanding of compiler bug- related research by doing a multi-vocal literature review. This research work talks about different categories of compiler bugs, differences between them, current status of bugs, techniques to solve those bugs and most importantly represent research gap between academic and professional research over compiler bugs.</p>

                        <p> <strong> An IOT based Automated Door Accessing System for Visually Impaired People </strong></p>
                        <p>This project proposed a conceptual framework to develop an automated door access system. A prototype for the proposed system was developed integrating features like visitor authentication using face recognition, voice command to open door, suspicious activity detection using audio alert and recognizing harmful objects visitors may carry using object and metal detection. This proposed system will reduce the dependency of a visually impaired person and give them a sense of self sufficiency while strengthening security at home.</p>
