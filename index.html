                <h2>Welcome to My Website!</h2>
                <p>My name is Farhat Lamia Barsha. I am a PhD student in Computer Science at Tennessee Technological University, where I also completed my Master’s degree in Computer Science. My research focuses on addressing challenges in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), particularly mode collapse detection, mitigation, and explainability.</p>
                <p>With over four years of combined academic and professional experience, I have worked as a Graduate Research and Teaching Assistant, contributing to research on compiler defects, GAN-based credit card fraud detection, and infrastructure-as-code security. Additionally, I have industry experience as an AI/ML Developer Intern and Junior Software Quality Assurance Engineer.</p>
                <p>I have published multiple peer-reviewed articles on topics ranging from malware detection to adversarial machine learning, GAN applications, and compiler defect categorization. My work has been recognized with awards, including "Best Poster Award" at Tennessee Tech’s Research and Creative Inquiry Day and "Best Paper Award" at IEEE WIECON-ECE 2019.</p>
                <p>Feel free to explore my work and connect with me to discuss innovative ideas in GAN, Explainable AI and beyond!</p>
